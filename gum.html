        <h1>Meet Gummy</h1>
        <p>
            Gummy is a lovable giant. He is a long hair cat with nothing but love to give. He is not good with children and it perfect for a married couple.
            He is a relaxed baby that spends most of the day sleeping. He also loves to sit in cat houses and play with lots of toys!
