            Meet Tiger
        </h1>
        <p>
            Tiger is a playful, shy cat. He is very selective on who he is around, so feel special if he picks you! We found Tiger
            stuck in a tree nearby the shelter as a kitten. He sleeps all day and loves to play all night. He will need tons of cat 
            toys to keep him entertained. He is the perfect buddy for a younger adult. Check out our kitty checklist today to see
            if you qualify to adopt tiger!
